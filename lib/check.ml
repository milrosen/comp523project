(* TODO: Define Env *)
(* open Env *)

(* Phase one: building an environment *)
(* in this section, I would like to go through each of the
  macro definitions in order, building up the Gamma and Phi 
  contexts, as well as the rho substitution environment *)



(* Phase two: checking the rest of the program as well as
  macro templates *)
(* in this section, we should be able to recieve some Gamma
  and phi, and then see if the macros are possible to expand *)
(* I believe that the output of this section should be the "typed"
  AST written in the Surface language *)
